# Image_processing
Filter the distortion in the Image

The repository includes different image processing tasks:

Example 1: Fourier Transform and Spectrum Analysis
Read an image and convert it to a double intensity image.
Calculate the Fourier transform and display it.
Shift the Fourier transform and display the log-amplitude spectrum.
Example 2: Filtering and PSF Analysis
Apply a rectangular point spread function (PSF) filter to an image.
Display the filtered image and its Fourier transform.
Analyze the PSF and display its log-magnitude spectrum.
Example 3:  Image Processing Tasks
Perform additional image processing tasks, such as wavelength calculations and matrix operations.
